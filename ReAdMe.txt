INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE:

WARNING:  The project has limited error handling support.  Assumption
is made that the programmer will not use stupid property value - e.g.
margins that are larger than the page ... duh.

A Test Project Group is included that shows some of the uses of the
component (see frmTest in the qPrinterTest project)

To use the class(es) in another project, add the qPrinter project to
the project group.  Add a reference from you project. Alternatively, 
compile the qPrinter project and add a reference to qPrinter.dll.
